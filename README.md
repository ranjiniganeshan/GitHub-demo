GitHub Demo
This is a demo for Git workflow, which scans all repositories in an organization and performs various checks, such as verifying that a team has been added and that a pull request has been reviewed before merging to the master branch. The code generates a table with the organization and repository name, and only considers the master branch and ignores other branches.
